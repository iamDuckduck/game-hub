component shouldn't know anything about http request

\*Displaying the Genres
html by default is 100% width

\*how do we share state between two components?

\*the component holding the state should be the one holding it

\*what is a hook?

*passing data down to many layer of children components 
by props may  not be a good idea. (imagine we have a more

const Emoji = ({ rating }: Props) => {
  const emojiMap: { [key: number]: ImageProps } = {
    3: { src: meh, alt: "meh", boxSize: "25px" },
    4: { src: thumpsUp, alt: "recommended", boxSize: "25px" },
    5: { src: bullsEye, alt: "exceptional", boxSize: "35px" },
  };
  return <Image {...emojiMap[rating]} />;
};
